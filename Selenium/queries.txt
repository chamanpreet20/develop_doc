-why we need constructor,
-can we create all methods and variables static to avoid making objects.
-constructor runs same as main method? If we have created only objects in main method and in constructor passed value and print. Should it print?

-why created object of child class but reference Is given of parent class
 Car C = new Ford();-- Car is parent class n ford is child class.

- Cannot create object of abstract class then how would we call concrete method of abstract?
