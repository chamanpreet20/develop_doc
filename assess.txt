continue- delivering work with quality and on time, working on selenium and jmeter to gain expertise, taking complete owwnership of projects, being a team player, handling projects independently, communicating risk to avoid delays, providing testing estimates, utilizing time for self development.
start- leading projects, reviewing them, practively participating in meetings and open discussions, learn selenium RC and ditributed load testing using master slave.
stop- accepting things communicated verbally. Will ask for requirement in written for each and every point.
